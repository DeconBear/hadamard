# Agent Runtime Benchmark Results

## Three-Runtime Parity Run (2026-06-10 evening) — partially invalidated by provider quota

Full `bench:long:parity` + `bench:complex:parity` run on branch
`feat/long-task-parity`. Mid-run, the shared DeepSeek endpoint began rejecting
requests with `429 · Token Plan usage limit exceeded (2056)` (verified in
`agentCommand.stderr` of the official-SDK report and reproduced live with a
minimal Bridge SDK probe). All three runtimes share the same
`~/.actoviq/settings.json` / `~/.claude/settings.json` DeepSeek credentials, so
later phases were starved:

| Phase (chronological) | Result | Validity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clean SDK long (5 cases) | **5/5, avg 0.975** | valid (pre-quota) |
| Bridge SDK long | 4/5, avg 0.839 (release-train miss was genuine) | valid (pre-quota) |
| Official SDK long | 1/5 — 4 cases died on `429 usage limit (2056)` | **invalid (quota)** |
| Clean SDK complex (9 cases) | **9/9, avg 0.985** | valid (lean requests stayed under throttle) |
| Bridge SDK complex | 0/9 — every case hung retrying 429s until the 180s budget killed it (`exit null`, `llmReq<=1`) | **invalid (quota)** |
| Official SDK complex | aborted manually (same starvation pattern) | not run |

Takeaways: Clean SDK swept 14/14 across both suites in this run; the only
valid cross-runtime comparison is the long suite where Clean (5/5) edged
Bridge (4/5). Official/Bridge complex numbers must be re-run after the quota
window resets. The runner now prints the agent command's stderr tail on
failures so provider-side 429/5xx causes are visible directly in the run log.

## Bridge/Official Retest After Quota Reset + Credential Routing Fix (2026-06-10 ~23:30)

Two fixes landed before the retest (commits `fe2f126`, `af99107`):

1. Bridge child env and the official-SDK runner now derive `ANTHROPIC_*`
   variables from `~/.actoviq/settings.json` (`mapActoviqEnvToAnthropicEnv`),
   so neither runtime falls back to `~/.claude` credential sources. Actoviq
   settings are now the single configuration source for all three runtimes.
2. The official runner preserves partial progress and the error event when the
   SDK stream throws, and a missing turn budget now means unlimited turns for
   all three runners alike.

Retest (single trial per case, quota restored):

| Suite | Clean SDK | Bridge SDK | Official Claude SDK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| complex (9 cases) | 9/9, avg 0.985 | **9/9, avg 0.996** | **9/9, avg 0.964** |
| long (5 cases) | **5/5, avg 0.975** | 4/5, avg 0.838 | 4/5, avg 0.840 |

Reports: `bench/reports/bridge-retest-{long,complex}`,
`bench/reports/official-retest-{long,complex}`; Clean numbers are from the
same-evening parity phases (pre-quota, valid).

Observations:

- Pass rates are now effectively at parity on the complex suite (9/9 for all
  three). On the long suite Clean SDK is the only 5/5 runtime; Bridge and
  official both failed `release-train-reconciliation` on the same hidden
  `blocked items: 0` literal that Clean missed in its own first validation run
  — a hard instruction-following case, not a grader artifact.
- Delegation gap persists: official used subagents heavily
  (multi-file-regression 11, parallel-audit 5); Bridge/Clean mostly 0.
- Harness gap: trials killed at `budget.maxSeconds` (two ~180s official/bridge
  trials) pass graders but lose metrics (`tools=-`); metrics should be flushed
  periodically so budget kills keep partial metrics.

## Long Suite — Clean SDK Validation (2026-06-10)

First real Clean SDK run over the five `bench/cases/long/` cases on branch
`feat/long-task-parity` (in-loop auto-compact, parallel read-only tools,
tool-result budgets, truncation recovery, fallback model, unlimited default
`maxToolIterations`).

| Case | First run | Rerun | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `complex.long.coding.plugin-regression-sweep` | PASS (0.930) | — | |
| `complex.long.ops.multi-ticket-operations` | PASS | — | |
| `complex.long.docs.api-drift-synthesis` | PASS | — | |
| `complex.long.workflow.release-train-reconciliation` | FAIL | PASS (0.944) | First run omitted the required `blocked items: 0` literal — genuine instruction-following miss. |
| `complex.long.safety.supply-chain-review` | FAIL | PASS (0.995) | First failure was an over-literal hidden grader (required the words `secret`/`mitigation`); checker broadened to semantic equivalents, deterministic core assertions unchanged. |

Caveats: this is 3/5 single-run plus 2 reruns, not a stable single-run 5/5;
`subagents=0` across all long cases (delegation still does not happen
naturally); run-to-run variance remains the main open issue.

## Latest Hard Subagent Capability Probe

The latest targeted parity run uses the new
`complex.workflow.parallel-audit` case. This case is deliberately harder than
the earlier natural workflow case: it asks the runtime to use delegated-agent
capability when available, fixes two independent regressions, requires
`repair-notes.md`, checks benchmark-internal access, and scores subagent/tool
behavior separately from deterministic task correctness.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Generated report timestamp | `2026-06-04T18:06:05.842Z` |
| Command | `npm run bench:parity -- --cases "bench/cases/complex/workflow-parallel-audit.json"` |
| Case | `complex.workflow.parallel-audit` |
| Result | All three runtimes passed deterministic graders and policy audit. |

| Runtime | Passed | Score | Behavior | LLM Requests | Tool Calls | Tool Errors | Subagent Calls | Policy |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Clean SDK | 1/1 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 21 | 26 | 0 | 1 | pass |
| Bridge SDK | 1/1 | 0.995 | 0.955 | 1 | 22 | 1 | 2 | pass |
| Official Claude Agent SDK | 1/1 | 0.964 | 1.000 | 12 | 17 | 0 | 7 | pass |

Interpretation:

- Clean SDK now exercises a real `Task`/`debugger` subagent path in this hard
  case and records child run metadata without exposing benchmark internals.
- Bridge SDK also uses delegated-agent behavior; the harness now counts both
  Bridge `Task` and `Agent` tool invocations as subagent calls.
- Official Claude Agent SDK shows the strongest subagent count, but needed the
  case-level `maxTurns: 20` budget and scored lower on efficiency.
- The benchmark now distinguishes final correctness from orchestration behavior;
  a runtime can pass task graders but still lose behavior score for missing
  delegated-agent signals, tool errors, or internal-access violations.

## Current Validity Note

The original three-runtime result below is a historical run and should not be
used alone as a final capability claim. A later leakage audit found harness
weaknesses and added benchmark-internal access checks. See
`bench/BENCHMARK_LEAKAGE_AUDIT.md` for the current interpretation.

After the audit, Clean SDK no longer has a stable "full score" claim. It can
pass all eight complex cases in a single run, but later full parity and targeted
reruns showed run-to-run variability. The latest audited full parity run had
zero benchmark-internal access for all runtimes, but produced mixed pass rates:
Clean SDK 6/8, Bridge SDK 8/8, and Official Claude Agent SDK 7/8. Targeted
reruns then passed the dialogue checker and Clean workflow cases after fixing an
overly literal dialogue grader.

This file records the three-runtime complex benchmark run for Actoviq agent
runtime parity. The raw generated reports live under `bench/reports/`, which is
ignored by Git; this checked-in summary keeps the comparable result visible.

## Benchmark Shape

The run uses the repository-local benchmark harness in `bench/`. Each case gives
the agent a natural task prompt and an isolated copied workspace. The prompt does
not prescribe a fixed ReAct script, required plan, required tool order, or
required subagent usage. The harness grades the final state with deterministic
checks and separately records observable behavior.

The current score is weighted as:

| Component | Weight | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Task correctness | 70% | Deterministic graders such as commands, file state, and policy checks. |
| Efficiency | 20% | Runtime metrics such as duration, tool calls, and token/request budgets when available. |
| Behavior | 10% | Observable execution quality, including tool errors and permission issues. |

The suite is designed to test Claude Code-like general agent behavior: coding
edits, terminal workflows, policy/tool API interaction, local docs synthesis,
long-log debugging, skill loading, safety boundaries, and workflow review. It
records LLM requests, tool calls, tool errors, subagent calls, and skill loads.
Subagent or skill use is measured from runtime logs, not forced by the prompt.

## Overall Scores

| Runtime | Passed | Total | Pass Rate | Average Score | Wall Duration | LLM Requests | Tool Calls | Tool Errors | Subagent Calls | Skill Loads |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Clean SDK | 8 | 8 | 100.00% | 1.000 | 417.1s | 68 | 101 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| Bridge SDK | 8 | 8 | 100.00% | 0.995 | 465.6s | 96 | 87 | 5 | 0 | 1 |
| Official Claude Agent SDK | 8 | 8 | 100.00% | 0.968 | 366.4s | 86 | 93 | 6 | 22 | 1 |

Primary correctness is equal in this run: all three runtimes passed all eight
cases. The score differences come from efficiency and behavior signals, not
failed graders.

## Behavior Comparison

Clean SDK produced the best score in this run: 8/8 pass rate and 1.000 average
score. It also had the lowest LLM request count, with 68 total requests across
the suite. The main gap is not correctness in these cases; it is orchestration
parity. Clean SDK did not actually invoke subagents in this run, while the
official baseline invoked subagents in three cases.

Bridge SDK also passed all cases. It scored 0.995, mostly due to behavior-score
reductions in several cases and five recorded tool errors. It used more LLM
requests than Clean SDK, 96 versus 68. During the run, the harness repeatedly
printed Windows `EBUSY` warnings while removing temporary benchmark workspaces.
Those warnings did not fail graders, but they are worth tracking as cleanup
stability noise for the bridge path on Windows.

Official Claude Agent SDK passed all cases and was the fastest by wall-clock
duration in this run, but had the lowest average score at 0.968. The official
runtime showed the strongest subagent behavior signal: 22 total subagent calls,
including 18 in `complex.workflow.subagent-review`. Its lower scores came from
efficiency and behavior penalties, not failed task correctness.

## Interpretation

For end-state task correctness, all three runtimes are currently equivalent on
the implemented complex local suite. For efficiency, Clean SDK is strongest in
LLM request count and average score. For Claude Code-like orchestration behavior,
Official Claude Agent SDK exposes the clearest subagent usage, which means Clean
SDK still needs targeted parity work even though this run is green.

The next benchmark improvement should add cases where subagent delegation is not
forced by the prompt but is naturally useful enough that a Claude Code-like
runtime tends to invoke it. The current `complex.workflow.subagent-review` case
observes this difference, but its deterministic grader does not require
delegation, so Clean SDK can still score 1.000 without exercising that capability.

## Follow-Up Gaps

- Add repeated trials for variance and pass^k reliability.
- Add a subagent-beneficial workflow case with richer independent review paths.
- Preserve and compare subagent task descriptions in the checked-in summary, not
  only raw counts.
- Investigate Bridge SDK Windows temporary workspace cleanup warnings.
- Keep `official-claude-sdk` as an external Claude Code capability baseline while
  Clean SDK converges on tool, skill, permission, and subagent parity.
# Clean SDK Subagent Parity Run - 2026-06-14

## Scope

This run focused on the three local workflow cases after the Clean SDK subagent
runtime was expanded with addressable agents, background notifications,
continuation, Markdown definitions, and worktree isolation.

Command:

```text
npm run bench:parity -- --cases "bench/cases/complex/workflow-*.json"
```

All cases use isolated copied workspaces and deterministic end-state graders.
Agent process exit and timeout data remain in the report as stability evidence,
but task pass/fail is tied to setup and final graders. The
`workflow-parallel-audit` turn budget is 28 because the previous 20-turn limit
cut off both Clean and the official SDK after the implementation was already
correct.

## Results

| Runtime | Passed | Average Score | LLM Requests | Tool Calls | Tool Errors | Subagent Calls | Continuations | Background Calls |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Clean SDK | 3/3 | 0.983 | 60 | 77 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Bridge SDK | 3/3 | 0.981 | 26 | 59 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 1 |
| Official Claude Agent SDK | 3/3 | 0.935 | 70 | 77 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 1 |

| Case | Clean | Bridge | Official |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `complex.workflow.agent-continuation` | 0.992 | 0.957 | 0.891 |
| `complex.workflow.parallel-audit` | 0.975 | 1.000 | 0.930 |
| `complex.workflow.subagent-review` | 0.981 | 0.987 | 0.984 |

## Behavior Findings

- All three runtimes passed every deterministic grader.
- Clean was the only runtime that continued the same persisted subagent in the
  continuation case: one `SendMessage` continuation and one background launch.
- Bridge and the official SDK both launched a second reviewer instead of
  continuing the first one in that case.
- Official subagent counts are derived from top-level `Agent`/`Task` calls.
  This avoids the previous duplicate count from task-start and child assistant
  events.
- Clean's tool errors were observable debugging actions: expected failing test
  runs, mismatched `Edit.old_string` retries, and one explicitly timed
  `TaskOutput` wait. Final state remained correct.
- The Clean Bash tool now runs through a real POSIX shell on Windows (Git Bash)
  instead of `cmd.exe`, eliminating false failures for commands such as `ls`.

The generated per-runtime JSON, Markdown, and JSONL trajectories remain under
`bench/reports/` and are intentionally not source artifacts.
