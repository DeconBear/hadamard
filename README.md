**Hadamard** (`0.4.x`) is a TypeScript agent SDK and agent-team platform with TUI, GUI, Bridge, and multi-agent collaboration. A future **1.0** line will stabilize package subpath contracts; that surface is **not published yet**.

> **Package name:** the published npm package remains [`actoviq-agent-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/actoviq-agent-sdk). Product, repo, CLI, and config paths use **Hadamard** (`hadamard-*`, `~/.hadamard`, `.hadamard/`).

> **Note:** The desktop **Agent graph** orchestration UI (visual team / graph editor) is **still under active iteration and optimization** — expect UX and API changes. Prefer `/team`, saved team definitions, and the SDK `createTeam()` / graph runtime for production workflows today. See `CHANGELOG.md`.

Inspired by Claude Code, Codex, Deepagents, and the broader agent ecosystem. Hadamard remains independent with its own public surface and documentation.

## Vision

- **Multi-agent**: subagent delegation (Task tool), panel-analysis teams, reviewer-auditor pairs, dynamic workflows — agents collaborating, not just a single loop.
- **Multi-runtime state management**: bridge configs have two explicit modes. `Direct API` calls Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible providers in-process; `External CLI` manages installed Claude Code, Codex, Pi, CodeWhale, Reasonix, or Crush runtimes as child processes and preserves native session identities when the CLI protocol exposes them.
- **Model team collaboration**: leaders dispatch to specialists (`/model router`), panel members investigate in parallel with structured convergence, reviewers report only verifiable issues — teams as first-class tools the agent invokes.

## Highlights

- **Model Team** — `panel-analysis` (parallel investigation + convergence) and `reviewer` (verifiable-issues-only auditor). Runtime-owned member pooling, streamed `TeamEvent`s, per-member provider config, and inherited permission/retry boundaries.
- **Model Router / Leader-Dispatch** — a leader classifies each turn and dispatches it to the best specialist route (any model/provider), runs normally, and the executor may itself convene a team. Profiles in `~/.hadamard/routers/`.
- **Dynamic Workflows** — JS script-based orchestration with explicit trust levels: trusted compatibility execution, isolated local-process execution, or a host-supplied remote/container sandbox for adversarial inputs.
- **Bridge (named runtime configs)** — choose `Direct API` for provider-level reuse, or `External CLI` to launch installed Claude Code, Codex, Pi, CodeWhale, Reasonix, or Crush; reuse each CLI's native login/config, stream normalized tool and assistant events, stop background work, and browse/resume supported native conversations. An explicit key override is injected only into the child and is not written to the CLI's credential store; Pi, CodeWhale, Reasonix, and Crush keep isolated per-config session profiles so that key-mode history survives restarts without reading the native login store.
- **Desktop GUI (`hadamard-gui`)** — Electron chat UI: streamed transcript, conversation history, command palette, settings, per-tool permission prompts. Security-hardened. Global **Assistant** FAB (Global/Project scope). The visual **Agent graph** orchestration UI is shipping in-progress and continues to be iterated (not a stable product surface yet).
- **TUI (`hadamard-tui`)** — Terminal UI with 25+ slash commands, Claude Code-style UX: `/team`, `/bridge`, `/plan`, `/hooks`, `/mcp`, `/review`, `/context`, `/cost`, `/doctor`, and more. Live status spinner, scrollback transcript, todo panel, permission dialogs with project/user scope, sub-command autocomplete.
- **Plan mode + hooks** — `EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode` tools with plan file; user-configurable `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`SessionStart` hooks from `settings.json`.
- **Worktree Tools** — `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree` with stack-based cwd, `.worktreeinclude`, PR checkout.
- **TavilySearch** — AI-optimized web search, pure TypeScript.
- **Standard Benchmark** — Self-contained framework with DeepSeek judge, HTML dashboard, 4-agent comparison.

## 1.0 SDK architecture

- `core`: immutable `AgentSpec`, canonical input/output items, structured output, guardrails, usage, and run errors.
- `providers`: capability-checked OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat-compatible, and Anthropic adapters behind one `ModelProvider` contract.
- `runtime`: one `AgentRuntime`, lazy `RuntimeServices`, fixed-stage middleware, tools/policy, bounded streams, checkpoints, interruption, and resume.
- `node`: tenant-scoped SQLite session/checkpoint/memory/artifact stores and backup-first JSON v1 migration.
- `events` and `surfaces`: versioned traceable `RunEvent`s plus shared CLI/TUI/GUI/Bridge semantics and redaction.
- `orchestration`, `workflow`, and `profiles`: agent-as-tool, handoff, durable spawn, graphs/presets, explicit workflow trust, and six composable agent profiles.
- `compat`: the 0.x root façade and migration adapters, retained throughout the 1.x line.

## Roadmap — toward agent teams

- **Swarm coordination** — mailbox-based inter-agent communication, task queues, shared knowledge graph.
- **Persistent team memory** — team-scoped context that survives across sessions and member changes.
- **Cross-runtime session continuity** — resume a bridge runtime's session exactly where you left it, regardless of which config was active.
- **Model team IDE** — visual team builder, member role editor, team health dashboard.

## Install

Node.js 22.13+ or Node.js 24 is required. Node 22.5–22.12 exposes
`node:sqlite` only behind a process flag and is therefore outside the default
runtime support contract.

```bash
npm install actoviq-agent-sdk zod
```

For local examples, place your config at:

```text
~/.hadamard/settings.json
```

You can also preload a custom JSON file with `loadJsonConfigFile(...)`.

## Quick Start (1.0 runtime)

```ts
import type { AgentSpec } from 'actoviq-agent-sdk/core';
import { ModelRegistry, OpenAIResponsesProvider } from 'actoviq-agent-sdk/providers';
import { AgentRuntime } from 'actoviq-agent-sdk/runtime';

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  models: new ModelRegistry([
    new OpenAIResponsesProvider({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY }),
  ]),
});
const agent: AgentSpec = {
  id: 'concise-chat',
  name: 'Concise chat',
  instructions: 'Answer in one short sentence.',
  model: 'openai-responses:gpt-4.1-mini',
};

try {
  const result = await runtime.run(agent, 'What is compare-and-swap?');
  console.log(result.output, result.usage.totalTokens);
} finally {
  await runtime.close();
}
```

Existing 0.x applications may keep importing `createAgentSdk` from the package root or `/compat`; new applications should use the responsibility subpaths above.

Run the repository examples with:

```bash
npm run example:hadamard-quickstart
npm run example:hadamard-agent-helpers
npm run example:profiles
```

## CLI REPL

After installing the package, you can start an interactive scrollback-mode REPL directly from the terminal:

```bash
npx hadamard-react [work-dir]
```

This launches a readline-based interactive agent with:
- Real-time streaming output in the main terminal buffer (native scrollback)
- Tab completion for slash commands, including session model, permission, compact, and resume controls
- Command history via ↑↓ arrow keys
- Ctrl+C to abort the current request, press twice to exit

**Note:** `hadamard-react` is a lightweight scrollback REPL, **not a full-featured TUI**. It does not use an alternate screen buffer, ScrollBox, or rich terminal rendering. It is designed for quick interaction and debugging. For the full terminal UI, use `hadamard-tui` below.

## Terminal UI (TUI)

`hadamard-tui` is the full terminal UI, modeled on Claude Code's REPL design: the transcript prints into native scrollback while a redrawable bottom region hosts the status line, a Claude-style prompt bar, the slash-command menu, and permission dialogs.

```bash
npx hadamard-tui [work-dir] [options]

# Options
#   --config <path>            Load a specific Hadamard settings JSON file
#   --permission-mode <mode>   default | acceptEdits | plan | bypassPermissions (default)
#   --model <model>            Override the configured model
#   --resume <session-id>      Resume a stored Hadamard SDK session
#   --continue                 Continue the most recently updated session
```

Features:

- **Streaming transcript in native scrollback** — assistant text, `⏺ Tool(args)` calls, and `⎿ ✓/✗` result lines flush into the normal terminal buffer; scrollback and copy/paste work as usual.
- **Live status line** — spinner, elapsed time, tool count, and the active tool while the agent works, over an always-visible mode line (model · permission · effort · team · bridge · context%) that shows context usage as a percentage of the window and turns yellow then red as it fills.
- **Claude-style prompt bar** — type `\` then `Enter` (or `Ctrl+J`) for a newline; `↑`/`↓` walk input history; the caret renders inline.
- **Slash-command menu** — type `/` to open a filtered menu (`↑↓` select, `Tab` complete, `Enter` run). `/resume` opens a searchable project-session picker.
- **`@` file completion** — type `@` to open a git-aware workspace file picker filtered by the partial path; subsequence fuzzy matching.
- **Team / workflow / worktree pickers** — `/team` activates a saved Model Team; `/workflows` runs a saved dynamic workflow; `/worktree` enters, exits, or lists git worktrees.
- **Permission presets + per-tool scope** — `/permissions` switches between read-only/workspace/full/plan presets; always-allow rules persist with project or user scope.
- **Mid-run steering** — keep typing while the agent works and press `Enter`: the message is queued and injected into the very next model request (shown as `⧗ queued`).
- **Plan mode + hooks** — `/plan` enters plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode` tools, plan file); `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`SessionStart` hooks from settings.json; `/hooks` lists them.
- **Bridge configs** — `/bridge config` manages named API or External CLI profiles for all six managed CLIs. `/bridge status`, `/bridge background`, `/bridge runs`, `/bridge stop`, `/bridge history`, and `/bridge resume` expose the same runtime lifecycle in the TUI and GUI; native history/resume remains subject to each installed CLI's protocol/version support.
- **Diagnostics + inspection** — `/doctor` checks config health; `/context` inspects the context window; `/cost`/`/usage` track token + spend (per-config breakdown); `/review` reviews the git diff; `/stats` shows session stats.
- **Context management built in** — the Hadamard SDK auto-compacts long sessions mid-run (full summary compact) and reactively recovers when a provider rejects an oversized prompt; notices surface as ∿ context compacted. History stays **append-only** between turns so automatic prefix caches (e.g. DeepSeek Context Caching) stay hot; Anthropic hosts still get explicit cache_control breakpoints. Oversized tool outputs are artifacted at write time rather than rewriting earlier messages.
- **MCP management** — `/mcp add`/`/mcp remove` manage stdio + remote HTTP MCP servers, persisted to `~/.hadamard/mcp.json`.
- **Image attachments** — `@<path>.png` tokens expand into image content blocks (in-process, read as base64).

Both CLIs share the same Hadamard SDK runtime defaults (Hadamard settings from `~/.hadamard/settings.json`, core tools, `bypassPermissions`, uncapped tool iterations) and run against any Anthropic-compatible or OpenAI-compatible provider.

By default, Hadamard SDK sessions are scoped to the current workspace under `~/.hadamard/projects/<workspace-key>`. Explicit `sessionDirectory` settings still take precedence.

Model tiers are provider-neutral aliases. Configure them with `HADAMARD_DEFAULT_MIN_MODEL`, `HADAMARD_DEFAULT_MEDIUM_MODEL`, and `HADAMARD_DEFAULT_MAX_MODEL`, then use `min`, `medium`, or `max` anywhere a model can be selected.

## Desktop GUI (`hadamard-gui`)

A local Electron desktop chat UI for the Hadamard SDK.

```bash
npx hadamard-gui [work-dir] [options]

# Options
#   --port <port>              Internal port to bind (default: 4174, auto-fallback if busy)
#   --config <path>            Load a specific Hadamard settings JSON file
#   --permission-mode <mode>   default | acceptEdits | plan | bypassPermissions (default)
#   --model <model>            Override the configured model
#   --resume <session-id>      Resume a stored session
#   --continue                 Resume the most recent stored session
```

It opens an Electron window backed by a localhost-only HTTP server. Features:

- **Streamed transcript** with markdown rendering and copyable code blocks, plus live tool-call cards
- **Conversation history on resume** — opening or switching a chat replays its stored messages
- **Command palette + slash commands**, settings (provider / model / keys / appearance), workspace switching, and empty-chat cleanup
- **Per-tool permission prompts** (queued so concurrent requests don't collide) and a token-usage readout
- **Project Documents + Issues** — each Project detail page has `Document` and `Issues` tabs. Issues use the guarded `backlog → todo → in_progress → in_review/blocked → done` lifecycle, support priorities, labels, acceptance criteria, comments, and links back to their worker sessions.
- **Agent graph orchestration UI** — visual team/graph editor lives in the GUI **Agent** region; **it is still being iterated and optimized** and should not be treated as a finished product surface. Prefer saved teams + `/team` / SDK APIs for stable workflows.
- **Agent Profiles for issue dispatch** — Settings → Models & routing can bind a named profile to a saved bridge config and model. `/issues start <id> [agent-profile]` asks the Project Manager for a worker brief, starts a linked session without changing the globally active runtime, and requires the worker to report through `IssueReport`.
- **Movable data root** — Settings → General can copy the complete Hadamard data root to an empty directory, validate it, write the bootstrap pointer, rebuild the SDK/session store, and retain the previous directory for manual cleanup.

**Security model:** the internal API is reachable only from loopback (Host + Origin allowlist, which defeats DNS-rebinding / CSRF) and requires a per-process token; the page ships a strict Content-Security-Policy. Electron runs with `sandbox`, `contextIsolation`, and no `nodeIntegration`.

Hadamard resolves its data root in this order: an explicit SDK `homeDir`, `HADAMARD_HOME`, `~/.hadamard/data-root.json`, then `~/.hadamard`. Project issues default to `<data-root>/projects/<workspace-key>/issues.json`; a project can instead use the protected workspace file `.hadamard/issues.json`.

> `electron` and `bun` are **optional** dependencies — installed only if you use the GUI / bridge runtime. The core SDK does not require them.
>
> **Bridge env overrides:** `HADAMARD_CLAUDE_PATH`, `HADAMARD_PI_PATH`, … (one per provider) to point the bridge at a specific runtime binary when it's not on `PATH`. See `docs/en/05-bridge-runtime.md`.

## Developer notes

- **Build before launching the CLIs/GUI:** `npm run build` (clean + `tsc`). Type-check only with `npm run typecheck`; run the suite with `npm test -- --run`.
- **Team behavior is centralized:** extend teams through `src/team/teamRuntime.ts` (`runMemberAgent` / `buildMemberIdentities` / `preflightMember`) rather than duplicating per-mode logic. Observe a run via `team.ask(prompt, signal, { onEvent })` and inspect `result.memberStatuses` / `result.incompleteReason`.
- **Router profiles are leader/dispatch configs:** a `RouterProfile` is a leader (`routerModel`) + a roster of specialist `routes` (each with `when` and optional `role` / `description`). `BUILT_IN_ROUTER_PROFILES` ships a ready-made `dispatch` profile; a user file of the same name in `.hadamard/routers/` shadows it.
- Contributor-facing documentation lives in this README and under `docs/`.
