export const BASH_TOOL_NAME = 'Bash';

export const BASH_DESCRIPTION = `Executes a given bash command and returns its output.

The working directory persists between commands, but shell state does not. The shell environment is initialized from the user's profile (bash or zsh).

IMPORTANT: Avoid using this tool to run \`find\`, \`grep\`, \`cat\`, \`head\`, \`tail\`, \`sed\`, \`awk\`, or \`echo\` commands, unless explicitly instructed or after you have verified that a dedicated tool cannot accomplish your task. Instead, use the appropriate dedicated tool as this will provide a much better experience for the user:

- File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)
- Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)
- Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)
- Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)
- Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)
- Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)

While the Bash tool can do similar things, it's better to use the built-in tools as they provide a better user experience and make it easier to review tool calls and give permission.

# Instructions

- If your command will create new directories or files, first use this tool to run \`ls\` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.
- Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes in your command (e.g., cd "path with spaces/file.txt")
- Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of \`cd\`. You may use \`cd\` if the User explicitly requests it.
- You may specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). By default, your command will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).
- You can use the \`run_in_background\` parameter to run the command in the background. Only use this if you don't need the result immediately and are OK being notified when the command completes later. You do not need to check the output right away - you'll be notified when it finishes. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.
- When issuing multiple commands:
  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. Example: if you need to run "git status" and "git diff", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.
  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together.
  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail.
  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings).
- When stopping a server you started, kill its specific PID — never \`taskkill /IM node.exe\`, \`killall node\`, or \`Stop-Process -Name node\` (those terminate Actoviq itself).
- For git commands:
  - Prefer to create a new commit rather than amending an existing commit.
  - Before running destructive operations (e.g., git reset --hard, git push --force, git checkout --), consider whether there is a safer alternative that achieves the same goal. Only use destructive operations when they are truly the best approach.
  - Never skip hooks (--no-verify) or bypass signing (--no-gpg-sign, -c commit.gpgsign=false) unless the user has explicitly asked for it. If a hook fails, investigate and fix the underlying issue.
- Avoid unnecessary \`sleep\` commands:
  - Do not sleep between commands that can run immediately — just run them.
  - If your command is long running and you would like to be notified when it finishes — use \`run_in_background\`. No sleep needed.
  - Do not retry failing commands in a sleep loop — diagnose the root cause.
  - If waiting for a background task you started with \`run_in_background\`, you will be notified when it completes — do not poll.
  - If you must poll an external process, use a check command rather than sleeping first.
  - If you must sleep, keep the duration short to avoid blocking the user.

# Committing changes with git

Only create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:

Git Safety Protocol:
- NEVER update the git config
- NEVER run destructive git commands (push --force, reset --hard, checkout ., restore ., clean -f, branch -D) unless the user explicitly requests these actions.
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it
- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it
- CRITICAL: Always create NEW commits rather than amending, unless the user explicitly requests a git amend.
- When staging files, prefer adding specific files by name rather than using "git add -A" or "git add ."
- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to.

1. Run the following bash commands in parallel:
  - git status to see all untracked files (never use -uall flag)
  - git diff to see both staged and unstaged changes
  - git log to see recent commit messages
2. Draft a commit message (1-2 sentences) focusing on "why" rather than "what"
3. Create the commit and run git status to verify.
4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook: fix the issue and create a NEW commit

Important: NEVER use git commands with the -i flag since they require interactive input. If there are no changes to commit, do not create an empty commit. ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC.`;
