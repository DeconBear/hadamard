# Actoviq Agent SDK Tutorial

This tutorial is a practical, step-by-step guide to the current SDK. It is organized so you can start with a working chat bot, then add tools, skills, sessions, MCP, and memory as needed.

The main execution path is `createAgentSdk()`. Use it for all product and application code.

If you only want to get moving quickly:

1. Read [01-setup-and-quickstart.md](./01-setup-and-quickstart.md).
2. Run `npm run example:actoviq-quickstart`.
3. Or start an interactive terminal surface:
   - `npx actoviq-react [work-dir]` for the lightweight scrollback REPL.
   - `npx actoviq-tui [work-dir]` for the full Clean SDK terminal UI.
